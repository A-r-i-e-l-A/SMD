## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The code provides a solution for automating the setup process of the SMT Pick and Place Machine in an electronic circuit assembly company. The hypothetical company uses two electronic board design programs that generate different types of files, which are not compatible with the company's SMT machines.
The main objective of the code is to facilitate the conversion of these files into a format compatible with the SMT machines and to load the resulting data into a database for further use in the assembly process. These formats are not explained in this project.

The core functionality of the code includes converting text files and CSV files generated by the electronic board design programs into a specific format we called "Placa".
Additionally, it allows for operations such as creating .asq files from the Placa data, converting Placas to CSV format, and selecting a specific component or position to serve as the center of the coordinate axis.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
You'll need to have Java installed in your computer to run the program (Java Runtime class version 61.0).

Open your favorite terminal, go to the folder where you saved the files and execute the following command:

`java -cp bin;lib/* FileConverterGUI`

In the Files folder there are examples for each kind of input and output file.

### Uploading Files
- Use the upload buttons to choose the text or CSV file generated by the electronic board design programs from your computer. The file information will be saved in the database with your given name/ID.

### Exporting PCB
- With the export buttons you can choose a PCB from the database and save its information in your computer.
  
### Choosing Center
- If you need to set a specific component as the center of the coordinate axis, click on the "Center Components" button, then input the PCB name and the component ID. This operation adjusts the positions of other components relative to the chosen center.

### Flipping Components
- To flip components on a PCB, click on the "Flip Components" button and select the PCB name. This operation multiplies the PosX values of the elements by -1, effectively flipping them across the Y-axis.

### Reload
- Updates the table with the information with the database. Useful to see the changes that have been made.

### Table
- Click on a PCB to see its components in another table.

## üìã Additional Information <a name = "information"></a>
If, for some reason, you were to look at the code, you'd see confusing nomenclature. That's because we didn't really plan ahead and improvised a lot. When we finished we realized half of the words wouldn't make sense to users so we changed a few things in the end.
