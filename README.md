## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The code provides a solution for automating the setup process of the SMT Pick and Place Machine in an electronic circuit assembly company. The company uses two electronic board design programs that generate different types of files, which are not compatible with the company's SMT machines.
The main objective of the code is to facilitate the conversion of these files into a format compatible with the SMT machines and to load the resulting data into a database for further use in the assembly process.

The core functionality of the code includes converting text files and CSV files generated by the electronic board design programs into a specific format we called "Placa".
Additionally, it allows for operations such as creating .asq files from the Placa data, converting Placas to CSV format, and selecting a specific component or position to serve as the center of the coordinate axis.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Selecting Files
- Use the "Select File" button to choose the text or CSV file generated by the electronic board design programs from your computer. These files contain the layout information of the electronic circuit boards.

### Converting Files to Placa
- Once the file is selected, click on the "Convert to Placa" button to convert the chosen file into the Placa format. This step ensures compatibility with the SMT machines used for assembly.

### Exporting Placas from Database
- If you want to export Placa data stored in the database to a location of your choice, click on the "Export Placa" button. This allows you to retrieve the Placa information for further analysis or use.

### Flipping Components
- To flip components on a Placa, select the desired Placa ID and click on the "Flip Components" button. This operation multiplies the PosX values of the elements by -1, effectively flipping them across the Y-axis.

### Choosing Center
- If you need to set a specific component or position as the center of the coordinate axis, input the Placa ID and the element ID, then click on the "Choose Center" button. This operation adjusts the positions of other elements relative to the chosen center, ensuring precise assembly.

By following these steps and utilizing the buttons provided in the Java GUI, you can efficiently manage and manipulate electronic circuit board data for seamless integration into the assembly process.
